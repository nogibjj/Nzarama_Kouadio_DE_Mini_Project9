    "Today, we will be using the ACS data we used during out first `pandas` exercise to examine the US income distribution, and how it varies by race. Note that because the US income distribution has a very small number of people with *extremely* high incomes, and the ACS is just a sample of Americans, the far right tail of the distribution will not be very well estimated. However, this data should suffice for helping to understand wealth inequality in the United States.\n",

If you recall from our last exercise, it seemed to be the case that most of the people who had incomes of 9999999 were children. Let's make sure that's true by looking at the distribution of the variable `age` for people for whom `inctot` is missing (i.e. subset the data to people with `inctot` missing, then look at the values of `age` with `value_counts()`).\n",
